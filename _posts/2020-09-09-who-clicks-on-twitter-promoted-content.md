I don't.

I usually block any account that turns up on my feed unsolicited. If the company is relevant in some way to me, I would just silence them.

I find that they show me zero relevant ads at the end of the day. That's probably because I don't like ads and even a tweet about a product I would like just seems unappealing with the promoted tag there.

Kinda the same with Youtube ads. If you want me to consider your product, interrupting my life, repeatedly, with the same annoying content is not a great way of achieving it.

I know this strategy focuses on brand recognition instead of selling that particular product but still I can't believe it is worth it.

I'm no marketer and I'm probably missing some points here, but I wanted to share this thought and hear what you have to say about it. So, please answer the poll and comment!
