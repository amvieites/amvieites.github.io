We are all in here because we want to work on something that highly motivates us, aren't we?
From the indie hacker perspective

The part-time version of a full-time $80000 Software Engineer job could be a 4h/day $40000 personal-project-friendly still-generating-recurrent-income job (just replace the figures with whatever makes sense in your area).

I am not talking about freelance or internships. I mean regular IT roles in a company, where one can still be close to the product, the co-workers and the culture.
From the company perspective

40h/week is a magic number. The work we have to do is organized matching that figure but it doesn't have to be.

Maybe we can't pay $200000 to a top engineer, but we can afford him part-time and he would definitely bring more than 50% of his value contributing to key decisions, guiding the team,...

The employee continuously improving his skills... in his free time!
Side-jobs should be ok

I get that this kind of relation between employer and employee can still be a hassel in some aspects, but so it was remote until April 2020.

What do you think?
