_Disclaimer: I know I risk projecting a pedantic image with the following words (also, the language doesn't help) but I only want to share my point of view about the way too many of us (and too often) just stay inside our own bubble without even thinking twice about it._

So, I decided to stop paying attention to people like me.

And who am I? A regular programmer in the first world who is doing ok in our privileged, 9-5, industry. I even go to some tech talks and meet-ups now and then!

I think I should start following interesting people. People that are producing content, sharing interesting articles that empower critical thinking and get the best out of me. Even better if I have to stand some criticism.

Why follow the Nth development-related few-hundred-thousand-followers account? People I mentioned above are producing much more interesting content (and probably some of them would RT that popular account sometime anyway).

I don't want articles about how good E Corp's IoT consultancy services are. That's propaganda they trust his employees will spread, not what makes me a better engineer.

I don't want to read an article about how the newsletters are here to stay (again). Instead, I want to read from those authors when they explain why they are starting that newsletter in the first place. Why in Substack or why they made it from scratch.

I don't want to read an article about the latest fancy JS framework (this one was easy, right?). Instead, I want to read about the indie hacker that is open sourcing that piece of code that turned out so much handy from his latest weekend project.

I don't want to read about the new unicorn in the sky. Instead, I want to read about people failing night by night. Until they don't.

I want to listen to makers, not marketers.

Pd. I feel like I have to clarify; This text doesn't aim to judge (not that anyone would care, anyway) the different ways of living people have. Just trying to share a thought and draw some attention on alternative ways of using the tools we have at hand.
