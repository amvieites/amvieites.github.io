I've worked as a developer in the fintech industry for 10 years. JVM-related stuff, mostly, at [Darwinex](https://www.darwinex.com).

Now I'm a #golang developer at [Xata](https://xata.io) making a database for #jamstack and lowcode solutions.

I'm usually responsive at <a href="https://twitter.com/amvieites">@amvieites</a>.

Also: climbing and ice/inline hockey.
